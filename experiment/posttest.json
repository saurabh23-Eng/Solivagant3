      "question": "What is the main advantage of using M-ary PSK over BPSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Lower bandwidth efficiency",
        "b": "Lower power efficiency",
        "c": "Higher bandwidth efficiency",
        "d": "Higher signal attenuation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Correct. M-ary PSK increases bandwidth efficiency by transmitting multiple bits per symbol."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "In 16PSK modulation, how many distinct phase states are used?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "4",
        "b": "8",
        "c": "12",
        "d": "16"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "Correct. 16PSK uses 16 different phase shifts to represent 4-bit symbols."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",

    {
      "question": "Which factor significantly affects the Bit Error Rate (BER) in M-ary PSK systems?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Carrier frequency only",
        "b": "Modulation index",
        "c": "Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)",
        "d": "Symbol synchronization"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Correct. BER in PSK systems is heavily influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Lower SNR results in higher BER."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
