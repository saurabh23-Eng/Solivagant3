### ðŸ”§ **Procedure (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Start MATLAB Software**

   * Launch MATLAB on your system.
   * Open a new script or use the Command Window to begin the simulation.

2. **Define Simulation Parameters**

   * Set the total number of bits to be transmitted.
   * Choose the modulation scheme: 8PSK or 16PSK.
   * Specify the range of SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) values in decibels.
   * Define any additional simulation settings as needed.

3. **Generate Random Bit Stream**

   * Create a stream of random bits.
   * Group bits appropriately:

     * 3 bits per symbol for 8PSK
     * 4 bits per symbol for 16PSK

4. **Map Bits to Symbols**

   * Convert the grouped bits into decimal symbol values.
   * Modulate the symbols using the selected PSK scheme.

5. **Add AWGN (Noise)**

   * For each SNR value, add Additive White Gaussian Noise to the modulated signal to simulate real-world conditions.

6. **Demodulate Received Signal**

   * Demodulate the noisy signal using the same PSK scheme.
   * Convert the demodulated symbols back to their original bit form.

7. **Calculate BER (Bit Error Rate)**

   * Compare the original transmitted bits with the received bits.
   * Calculate the Bit Error Rate for each SNR value.

8. **Plot BER Curve**

   * Plot a graph of BER versus SNR to analyze the performance of the modulation scheme.

9. **Repeat for Both Modulation Types**

   * Repeat the entire procedure for both 8PSK and 16PSK.
   * Compare the resulting BER curves to understand how modulation order affects performance.
