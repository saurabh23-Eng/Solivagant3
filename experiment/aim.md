## Aim of the Experiment.

To simulate the M-ary Phase Shift Keying (M-PSK) modulation technique using MATLAB software for 8PSK and 16PSK formats, and to calculate and analyze the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance under the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel.

Objectives:
- To understand the concept and implementation of 8PSK and 16PSK modulation.
- To simulate the impact of noise on MPSK-modulated signals.
- To compute and analyze the BER vs Eb/N0 performance curves.
