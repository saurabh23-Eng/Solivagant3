## - To understand the concept and implementation of 8PSK,16PSK,32PSK and 64PSK modulation.
## - To observe the impact of noise on MPSK-modulated signals.
## - To compute and analyze the BER vs Eb/N0 performance curves.
## - To calculate the  Bit error rate (BER). 
## - To compare the performance  of different M-PSK scheme in terms of BER vs SNR.
