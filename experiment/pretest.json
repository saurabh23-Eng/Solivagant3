      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. PSK stands for Phase Shift Keying, where data is transmitted by changing the phase of the carrier signal."

        "d": "fft()"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. The `awgn()` function adds noise to a signal at a specified SNR level."

      "question": "What is the main advantage of using M-ary PSK over BPSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Lower bandwidth efficiency",

        "c": "Higher bandwidth efficiency",
        "d": "Higher signal attenuation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Correct. M-ary PSK increases bandwidth efficiency by transmitting multiple bits per symbol."

    {
      "question": "Which factor significantly affects the Bit Error Rate (BER) in M-ary PSK systems?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Carrier frequency only",
        "b": "Modulation index",
        "c": "Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)",
        "d": "Symbol synchronization"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Correct. BER in PSK systems is heavily influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Lower SNR results in higher BER."

      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary trade-off when increasing the value of M in M-ary PSK (e.g., from 8PSK to 16PSK)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Higher bandwidth efficiency at the cost of increased BER for the same SNR",
        "b": "Lower power consumption but reduced data rate",
        "c": "Improved noise immunity with simpler hardware",
        "d": "Reduced phase ambiguity but higher latency"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Higher M improves bandwidth efficiency (more bits/symbol) but requires higher SNR to maintain the same BER."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "For a given SNR, why does 16PSK typically exhibit a higher BER than 8PSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because 16PSK symbols are closer in phase, making them more susceptible to noise",
        "b": "Because 16PSK uses a lower carrier frequency",
        "c": "Because 8PSK has a higher modulation index",
        "d": "Because 16PSK requires less transmit power"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Higher M packs more phase states (smaller angular separation), increasing the likelihood of demodulation errors due to noise."
