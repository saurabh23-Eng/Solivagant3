        "a": "Pulse Shift Keying",
        "b": "Phase Shift Keying",
        "c": "Periodic Signal Keying",
        "d": "Phase Sample Keying"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. PSK stands for Phase Shift Keying, where data is transmitted by changing the phase of the carrier signal."

      "question": "In 8PSK, how many bits are represented per symbol?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "2",
        "b": "3",
        "c": "4",
        "d": "1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. 8PSK transmits 3 bits per symbol because logâ‚‚(8) = 3."

      "question": "What type of noise is usually considered in digital communication simulations?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Impulse Noise",
        "b": "White Gaussian Noise",
        "c": "Thermal Noise",
        "d": "Pink Noise"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) is the standard model for noise in digital communication systems."
